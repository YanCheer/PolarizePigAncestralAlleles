# PolarizePigAncestralAlleles
This repository is deposited with scripts for polarization of ancestral alleles of pig reference genome (_Sscrofa11.1_). <br>

* Genome_Alignment_Scripts
The `Genome_Alignment_Scripts` directory includes the scripts of `Progressive Cactus` pipeline to align reference genomes together and deposit in HAL format. The `Linux Shell` scripts should be run in order 01, 02, 03. The other scripts and files will be automatically called by `.sh` scripts for running. <br>
